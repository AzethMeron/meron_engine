# @s - player

# Used only if Timed Ingame Spawn feature is used
# During respawning, this function is called every tick, for each of respawning players
# You can see how much time (ticks) is left by accessing scoreboard 'RespawnTimeLeft' in @s player
# Typically, it's used to show user feedback (how much time left until respawn)
