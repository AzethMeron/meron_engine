Tagged entities
"persistent"	used by all entities that are PERSISTENT - Can't be removed AT ALL
"engine"	Main armorstand used by engine, created during initialisation. @e[tag=engine,limit=1] CAN be used by YOU to store map settings and stuff like that. It's unique and "persistent" armorstand.
"first_spawn"	Armorstand created when setting first spawn, used to initiate players who never played on this server before. Persistent.
"spawn"	Armorstand created when setting spawn (typical one). Used for respawn of players that visited first spawn in the past. Persistent.
"lobby"	Used by "progression", armorstand used to spawn players during lobby phase. Persistent.
"game_creation"	Used by "progression", armorstand used to spawn players during game creation phase. It's supposed to be room with customization for incoming game. Persistent.
"game_creation_waiting"	Used by "progression", armorstand used to spawn players during game creation phase. It's supposed to be waitroom, where all other players wait when randomly chosen host chooses settings for incoming game. Persistent.
"FAKE_BLOCK"	used to create fake blocks (visible, but no collision) - summon minecraft:falling_block ~ ~ ~ {BlockState:{Name:"white_concrete"},NoGravity:1,Time:1,Tags:["FAKE_BLOCK"]}

Why first spawn?
Meron Engine uses VERY old way of handling new players. 
Basically, you can change spawnpoint for each individual player, but keep new players respawning at global spawn point.
So, i keep global spawn point at "first_spawn", then in spawning process i set for any new player spawnpoint to "spawn".

Spawning sequence (for players who never played on server before)
lobby phase: first_spawn -> trigger:initiate_stats -> trigger:first_spawn -> spawn -> trigger:spawn -> progression:spawn_lobby -> lobby
game creation phase: first_spawn -> trigger:initiate_stats -> trigger:first_spawn -> spawn -> trigger:spawn -> progression:spawn_game_creation -> game creation room
ingame phase: first_spawn -> trigger:initiate_stats -> trigger:first_spawn -> spawn -> trigger:spawn -> progression:spawn_ingame

InGame=-1 outsider
InGame=0 lobby phase
InGame=1 game creation phase
InGame=2 ingame phase
InGame=3 spectator

Functions - engine:
engine:destroy 	- kill all engine entities and "release" forceloaded chunks.
engine:gamerules	- gamerules set upon call to engine:init. You can customize them there
engine:init	- function used to create engine entity (@e[tag=engine,limit=1]), create scoreboards, set gamerules and more
engine:loop	- function that needs to be called every tick (you must put it in repeating commandblock manually)
engine:set_first_spawn 	- Set first spawn for the players (worldspawn)
engine:set_spawn	- Set typical spawn for players. Must be different place from first_spawn
engine:settings	- Settings for engine, you can customize them there BEFORE using engine:init

Functions - tools:
tool:add_death	- add death to @s player. Calls trigger:on_death
tool:add_kill	- add kill to @s player. Calls trigger:on_kill

############################################################

This is a list of all scoreboards used by engine, with brief description. I will try to keep it updated.
Decided to add notation for valid "vessel" of given scoreboard. Many scoreboards only make sense in specific (tho logical) cases.
@engine - refers to @e[tag=engine,limit=1] entity, main entity of the engine.
@a - refers to any player.
@e - refers to any entity.

VARIABLES (Editable)
KillSpreeTicks dummy	- @engine, time (in ticks) between kills for kill to count to Killing Spree
inp_Min dummy	- @e, minimal (>=) value for RNG - tool:random
inp_Max dummy	- @e, maximal (<=) value for RNG - tool:random 
Host dummy	- @a, whether player is a Host of game currently created game (Host=1) or not (Host=0). Used only during game creation phase.
RespawnTime dummy	- @engine, time (in ticks) how long respawn during in-game phase should take.
MaxHP dummy	- @a, maximal HP of given player, you must set this manually to use HPPercentage.
RegenIntervalTik dummy	- @engine, time (in ticks) between regeneration of 1 HP. In other words: regenerate 1 HP every RegenIntervalTik ticks.
inp_Chance dummy	- @e, input for tool:chance function, 0..100
ArrowIntervalTik dummy	- @engine,  time (in ticks) - cooldown for arrow, after shooting bow/crossbow get arrow back after ArrowIntervalTik
MultiKillPrevent dummy	- @a, if set to 1, player can only get single kill within 10 ticks (other kills are ignored) It's useful when making skills that may - but not must - increase killcounter on their own, you can use tool:add_kill to add kill manually. Multikill prevention takes care of "doublecounting" in such cases.
Sett_ArrowCD dummy	- @engine, Cooldown for arrows enabled (1) or disabled (0)
Sett_HpRegen dummy	- @engine, Custom HP regeneration enabled (1) or disabled (0)
Sett_SkillCD dummy	- @engine, Skill cooldowns enabled (1) or disabled (0). If disabled, all Cooldown_Skill_ variables are IGNORED by engine
InCombatTikLen dummy	- @engine, time (in ticks) how long players stays in combat after dealing/receiving damage (used for InCombat variable)

VARIABLES (Editable - cooldowns)
Ok seperate category cuz those work the same way (pretty much)
Each of them, if > 0, is decreased by 1 every tick. You can set them to any value, then wait until Cooldown_...=1 and call post-cooldown function or smt.
variables 1 to 9 and O have visual feedback, read more in Manual/test on your own. a to d are invisible, can be used for passives.
All cooldown variables refer to @a

RespawnSecLeft dummy	- @a, time (in seconds) remaining for the player to be respawned
Ticket dummy	- @a and @engine, random number (100..65535) that identifies every particular game

Sneaking minecraft.custom:minecraft.sneak_time	- @a, time (in ticks) spent continuously sneaking, resets to 0 once sneak button is released.

VARIABLES (Internal - this few can be read/modified in some scenarios, but it's bad practice, don't do it if you can help it)
itr_pKillCount playerKillCount	- @a, internal counter of kills, calls trigger if > 0, then decreases by 1
itr_deathCount deathCount	- @a, internal counter of deaths, calls trigger if > 0, then decreases by 1

VARIABLES (Strictly internal)
Those variables are temporary/counters/internal to the degree they're NOT useful outside engine.
itr_timer dummy	- @engine, timer used to call triggers:each_second (counts to 20 ticks, call function, then resets)
itr_KillSpreeTim dummy	- @a, timer which resets every kill, and which counts to KillSpreeTicks. When it reaches that value, it resets Killing Spree.
itr_temp dummy	- I don't remember, probably temporary variable used in various circumstances
itr_joined dummy	- @a, whether player got first-spawned (1) or not yet (undefined)
itr_regen dummy	- @a, timer which grants regeneration each RegenIntervalTik
itr_CooldownTick dummy	- I don't remember, will check if anyone ever requests it (which i deem unlikely)
itr_PrevHP dummy	- @a, HP of the player in PREVIOUS tick, used to calculate HpDelta
itr_MultiKillTik dummy	- @a, timer for Multikill Prevention system
itr_InCombatTik dummy	- @a, timer for InCombat
itr_SneakingPrev dummy 	- @a, value of Sneaking in previous tick. If it's the same as in current tick, then player stopped sneaking and Sneaking resets to 0.
